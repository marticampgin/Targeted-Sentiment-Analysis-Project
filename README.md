# Targeted-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

This project was an exam at the University of Oslo in the course IN5550 - Neural Methods in NLP. The goal was to fine-tune a Norwegian BERT-model for the task Targeted Sentiment Analysis for Norwegian product reviews across different categories.
My goal and idea was to explore cross-domain effects, i.e. training models on data from different domains, performing error analysis, and seeing how the model behaves in general. All the methodology, results, model, as well as dataset, are described in the .pdf-paper.
