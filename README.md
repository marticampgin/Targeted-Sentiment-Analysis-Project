# Targeted-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

This project was an exam at the University of Oslo in the course IN5550. The goal was to train the Norwegian BERT-model for Targeted Sentiment Analysis for product reviews. 
My goal was to explore cross-domain effects, i.e. training models on data from different domains, performing error analysis, and see how the model behaves in general. All the
results, the model, as well as the dataset are described in the .pdf-paper.
